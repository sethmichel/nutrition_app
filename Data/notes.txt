2000 calorie diet 100% convserion

mcg - move decimal left 3
g - move decimal right 3

Need to check everything not from teh nitriotnion value.org for units (the eaas)

add: protein, collagen, chia seeds, pumkin seeds, almond milk, the terriki thing
kiwi, spinach
speggeti noodles, marinara, tomato, zuccini, chicken, beef


specific servings
-apple: ~160-200 grams. done as 180g
-yellow squash: 115g (Summer squash, raw, yellow)
-zucchini: very hard to find
-chia seeds (3 tbsp = 30g) 2 tbsp = "daily requirement" of omega 3. But it's ALA which isn't as good as from fish



bugs:
enter servings on some random food, then don't enter servings on the food you click, it accepts this because it only checks if the parent grid has the ids "servings"

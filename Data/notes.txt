2000 calorie diet 100% convserion

mcg - move decimal left 3
g - move decimal right 3

Need to check everything not from teh nitriotnion value.org for units (the eaas)

add: protein, collagen, chia seeds, pumkin seeds, almond milk, the terriki thing
kiwi, spinach
speggeti noodles, marinara, tomato, zuccini, chicken, beef


specific servings
-apple: ~160-200 grams. done as 180g
-yellow squash: 115g (Summer squash, raw, yellow)
-zucchini: very hard to find
-chia seeds (3 tbsp = 30g) 2 tbsp = "daily requirement" of omega 3. But it's ALA which isn't as good as from fish


todo:
-reorganize nution json so it's like nutrion labels
-label how much healthy fats something has
-move "live & active cultures" to the top
-I think pobiotics are cutlures but not all cultures are probiotics. currently they're both in live and active cultures
-another problem is in CreateFood(), I multiply the nutrition facts by the serving size but this doesn't work for stings. So I could eat 0.1 of something but get the full string values
